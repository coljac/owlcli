# owlcli
Command line tool for launching VODs of Overwatch League matches, quick and spoiler-free. 

Uses the vod links provided by https://reddit.com/r/overwatched.

## Installation

(Will be on pip - for now just download and run the script)

## Usage

Just run `owl`/`python owl.py`; you will be presented with a list of matches and then a list of maps to start watching from. Any response that's not a valid number in the appropriate range will quit the utility.

## Notes

Next version will go up on pip and allow selecting the day as well - for now it's just the last day's matches.
